# Use Cases 

## Overview

Having finished with the requirements gathering stage, the next task in the process involved developing and analysing a list of use cases.  Each use case represents some interaction taking place between an actor and the DIY Tool Hire Service [8].

The use case analysis stage is essential to the development of a proper software system.  It is vital that each of the requirements listed in Table 2.1 is accounted for when creating the use cases.  This was accomplished using an iterative process, during which the requirements were expanded and modified, and the use cases were adapted to support those changes.

During the use case analysis period, the team completed the use case list, use case diagram, use case specifications, and the use case/requirements matrix.  These tables and figures are found in the following subsections of this chapter.

## Use Case Listing

When brainstorming the potential list of use cases, it was necessary for the team to determine who the actors would be when interacting with the DIY Tool Hire Service.  The list of actors that was decided on based on the requirements came to: Customer, Admin, Credit Card Company, Notification Service, Customer Support, Database, and Delivery Service.  With the requirements and these actors in mind, a list of use cases was established. Over the course of several iterations, the list was adapted until the final list below was developed.

      \caption{Use case listing}
 \end{table}

## Use Case Diagram

The use case listing from above was translated into a use case diagram.  The diagram presents the use cases in a more clearly illustrated manner. The team utilized the \textit{extend} relationship as a way to add optional behaviours to certain use cases, as well as the \textit{include} relationship to simplify larger use cases into more manageable parts [9].

 \end{figure}


## Use Case Specifications

Continuing the development process, the team took the use cases depicted above and provided a much more detailed information for each including a description, the actors involved, pre- and post-conditions, as well as the main and alternative flows.  As the use case specifications were written, further alterations took place with the list of use cases.  The list of use cases was refined, and the specifications continuously updated throughout the project as more thought went into the behaviours of the actors.  The following specifications for the finalized list of use cases played a key role in the upcoming design period of the project [8].

## Use Case/Requirements Matrix

The last task to accomplish during the use case analysis stage was to create a use case/requirements matrix.  This matrix, which displays the requirements on the left side and the use cases across the top, is intended to confirm that each of the requirements is being satisfied by one of the use cases and that each use case serves the purpose of meeting a requirement [4].  As seen below, the requirements and use cases established by the team satisfy these conditions.

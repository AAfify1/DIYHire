# Conclusion

In this chapter, an overview will be provided of the utilized strategy in order to give insights into the approach of the creation of the THS system. The team met on a weekly basis and , To increase the productivity, the team was divided into sub-groups to carry out varying work simultaneously and efficiently. During the weekly group discussion, the sub-groups results were reviewed by all the team members with an open discussion in order to achieve high quality and consistency between all members. The team worked in a reliable manner and internal deadlines were met. The weekly progress was monitored by the team’s advisor who gave feedback and advice for the tasks for the following week..  
 
The development approach was based on strong requirements and use cases. The declaration of actors and their functionalities  helped to create  the classes and methods required for the Object-Oriented Analysis stage. As the team wanted to ensure that the flow of use cases was represented properly, many iterations of object oriented diagrams were made. (See Appendix) Although a lot of time was spent on reviewing the diagrams, future iterations are possible in the development, which should be in line with the tenants of the Unified Process. 
 
The team has developed the project according to the standardised documentation of the Unified Modelling Language (UML) and  the process has been created with an Object Oriented approach to the Analysis and Design of a prototype version of the DIY tool renting website. 
 
Great communication and well coordinated teamwork could be observed throughout the duration of the course. Both internal and external deadlines were met.  Although the team met the weekly deadlines and worked well, there were aspects that could be considered to be done differently for future projects. There have been several  difficulties to synchronize the writing style between sections completed by different people. To minimize this, there were regular reviews on each member’s contribution in order to ensure consistency.
